# Submission Guide
This is the guide for creating and uploading your submission files.

## Submission Template
We require you to structure your submission in the following way.
Your submission **must include**:
- `description.pdf`: Description of your submission. Look at the file for detailed instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List all packages required by your solution here. Can be empty.
- `solution.py`: Entry point for the evaluation. Must contain the method `load_solution() -> DACPolicy`.

You can provide as many files as you want in your submission folder but be aware of the file size limit # TODO.
If you are unsure how to structure your submission please take a look at our examples in the challenges.

## Description
We require you to provide a description of your submission answering a few questions.
Please take a look at `description.pdf` for further instructions and the concrete questions.

## Pack Your Submission
The Bash script [`prepare_upload.sh`](prepare_upload.sh) may be used to package a submission
directory into a `.zip` file ready for submission.
