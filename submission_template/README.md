# Submission Guide
This is the guide for creating and uploading your submission files.

## Submission Template
We require you to structure your submission in the following way.
Your submission **must include**:
- `description.pdf`: Description of your submission. Look at the file for detailed instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List all packages required by your solution here. Can be empty.
- `solution.py`: Entry point for the evaluation. Must contain the method `load_solution() -> DACPolicy`.

You can provide as many files as you want in your submission folder but be aware of the file size limit.
If you are unsure how to structure your submission please take a look at our examples in the challenges.

## Description
We require you to provide a description of your submission answering a few questions.
Please take a look at `description.pdf` for further instructions and the concrete questions.

## Pack Your Submission
The Bash script [`prepare_upload.sh`](prepare_upload.sh) may be used to package a submission
directory into a `.zip` file ready for submission.
