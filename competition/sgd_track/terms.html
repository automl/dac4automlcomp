<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>In order to ensure a fair competition we require you to adhere to following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only interact with the DAC environment through its interface.</li>
<li>Do not edit the instances.</li>
<li>Do not add more observations. Preprocessing of the observations is allowed.</li>
<li>Do not directly edit the environment in the policy; just return your hyperparameter configuration as an action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Noncompliance will lead to disqualification from the competition.</p>
<p>The following are <strong>not</strong> eligible for being awarded prizes or featured in the final leaderboard of the competition:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Competition organizers and sponsors, their students, close family members (parents, sibling, spouse or children) and household members</li>
<li>Any person having had access to the truth values or to any information about the data or the Competition design giving him (or her) an unfair advantage</li>
<li>The CHALEARN employees, Directors, Officers, and Advisors, and their students, close family members (parents, sibling, spouse or children) and household members</li>
<li>Any person living in a country excluded by US export regulation and wherever else prohibited by law or any person banned by US authorities from receiving US funds</li>
</ul>
<p>The results on the leaderboard are based on shorter evaluations with a validation set, thus they may not reflect the final results. Placement on the CodaLab leaderboard does not guarantee any final standing, prizes or even eligibility for prizes. The exact length of the final evaluation may be extended if stochasticity presents a challenge in distiguishing the quality of submissions form one another. Generally, however, evaluation time will be used as a tie-breaker as measured on our own machines. Private measurments will not be accepted as substitutes. Participants are responsible for the time limit being kept.<br /><br />These rules are specific to this competition, furthermore the general ChaLearn contest rules apply.
