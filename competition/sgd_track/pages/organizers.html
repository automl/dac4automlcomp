<p>The AutoML groups of Freiburg and Hannover jointly organize this
challenge. Find more about us at <a

organizers, are:</p>

<p><strong>Theresa Eimer</strong> is a PhD student at the Leibniz
University Han- nover, supervised by Prof. Dr. Marius Lindauer. She
completed her Master’s degree at the Univer- sity of Freiburg. Her
research focuses on Dynamic Algorithm Configuration, specifically via
Rein- forcement Learning. She has authored and is maintaining DACBench,
a comprehensive benchmark library for DAC, as well as the contextual
Reinforcement Learning library CARL.</p>

<p><strong>Raghu Rajan</strong> is a PhD Student at the University of
Freiburg su- pervised by Prof. Dr. Frank Hutter. Part of his work
focuses on understanding dimensions that make environments hard for RL
algorithms. To this end, he has authored and maintains MDP Playground, a
library to inject dimensions of hardness in toy and complex environments
in RL. He also focuses on AutoRL using AutoML methods. His research
interests include Reinforcement Learning, Automated Reinforcement
Learning and Artificial General Intelligence. He obtained his MSc at the
University of Freiburg with a thesis at the intersection of Optimal
Control and Model- Based Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p><strong>Aditya Mohan</strong> is a PhD student at the Leibniz
University Han- nover, supervised by Prof. Dr. Marius Lindauer. He
obtained a dual Master’s degree from the Technical University of Berlin
and EURECOM, where he worked on the applying Meta-Learning to
cooperative multi-agent settings for his Master’s Thesis. He is
interested in studying General- ization in the fields of Reinforcement
Learning and Meta-Learning, where part of his work focuses on policy
transfer in the domain of Contextual Reinforcement Learning. To this
end, he has been involved with the CARL benchmark.</p>

<p><strong>Göktuğ Karakaşlı</strong> is a computer science graduate
student at the University of Freiburg and a research assistant in the
Machine Learning lab lead by Prof. Dr. Frank Hutter. He is working on
Practical Learned Hyperparameter Optimizers for Computer Vision and he
is maintaining the SGD environment in DACBench.</p>

<p><strong>Carolin Benjamins</strong> is a PhD student at the Leibniz
Univer- sity Hannover, supervised by Prof. Dr. Marius Lindauer. She
completed her Master’s degree at the Leibniz University Hannover. Her
research focuses on Dynamic Algorithm Configuration, Con- textual
Reinforcement Learning and Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO). She is a
maintainer for the HPO package SMAC3.</p>

<p><strong>Steven Adriaensen</strong> is a postdoctoral researcher at
the Univer- sity of Freiburg in the Machine Learning lab lead by
Prof. Dr. Frank Hutter. His general research interests lie at the
intersection of algorithmics and artificial intelligence. In particular,
how com- puters can help humans design better algorithms. He has
attained his doctor’s degree at the Uni- versity of Brussels, where he
investigated the semi-automated design of meta-heuristics for hard
combinatorial optimization. In Freiburg, his research focuses on Dynamic
Algorithm Configu- ration, specifically its applications to deep
learning, and the development of a more general DAC methodology by
combining ideas from reinforcement learning, static algorithm
configuration, and evolutionary optimization.</p>

<p><strong>Frank Hutter</strong> is a professor of machine learning at
the computer sci- ence department of the University of Freiburg
(Germany). He received his PhD from the Univer- sity of British Columbia
(2009), supervised by Holger Hoos, Kevin Leyton-Brown and Kevin Mur-
phy. He received a doctoral dissertation award, best paper awards from
IJCAI, JAIR, and AIJ, and first prizes in 10 international competitions
on AutoML, SAT solving, and AI planning. He orga- nized the configurable
SAT solver challenge
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/
CSSC2013/"> 2013</a> and <a href="http://aclib.net/cssc2014/">2014</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Marius Lindauer</strong> is a professor of machine learning a
the Leib- niz University Hannover since 2019. He received his BSc, MSc
and Phd at the University of Pots- dam, supervised by Torsten Schaub and
Holger Hoos, and was a postdoc under Frank Hutter at the University of
Freiburg from 2014-2019. His research focus is on automated machine
learn- ing, reinforcement learning and explainability. He organized
several competitions, including the German competition on general game
playing (2009 and 2010), the configurable SAT solver chal- lenge (2014)
and the open algorithm selection challenge (2017). Furthermore, he and
his teams won several tracks at international competitions, including
the SAT competition (2012), the ICON algorithm challenge (2015), the
AutoML challenge (2016 and 2018) and the BBO challenge (2020).</p>
