<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>We ask you to submit a solution policy, which dynamically adjusts the
hyperparameters of the algorithm being executed.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Your solution should be submitted as a <code>.zip</code>-file.</p>

<p>The <code>.zip</code>-file should not exceed TODO MBs and contain the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>metadata</code>: Empty file, required by CodaLab.</li>
    <li><code>requirements.txt</code>: The required packages to run your solution.</li>
    <li><code>solution.py</code>: It should contain a method loading your policy with the signature <code>def load_solution() -> DACPolicy</code>.</li>
    <li><code>description.pdf</code>: Description of your solution (1-2 pages). Please find more about the content in the
        <a href="https://github.com/automl/dac4automlcomp/submission_template/description.pdf">template description</a>.</li>
    <li>Optionally: Your training code.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you did not handcraft your policy, the code for generating the
policy should also be part of the submission. This solution policy needs
to be compatible with the evaluation code provided by us. You can take a
look at our examples on how to structure your submission and also take a look
at the <a href="https://github.com/automl/dac4automlcomp/submission_template">submission template</a>.</p>

<h3 id="evaluation-procedure">Evaluation Procedure</h3>
<p>We will perform several evaluation runs on all of our test instances
(instances not seen during training, but drawn from the same
distribution as the training instances). The final ranking of the
participants will be decided by their average rank on each instance. Our
metric for deciding the rank on a given instance is the mean performance
across seeds. While the competition is running, the performance ranks
for the leaderboard will be measured on a validation set. For the final
ranks of the participants, we will use an unseen test set.</p>
<p>TODO Reproducibility bonus?</p>

<p>We will also limit the evaluation cost:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CPU Time: TODO</li>
    <li>Memory: TODO</li>
    <li>Disk usage: TODO</li>
</ul>
