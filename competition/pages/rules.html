<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
In order to ensure a fair competition we require you to adhere to following rules:
<ul>
    <li>Only interact with the DAC environment through its interface.</li>
    <li>Do not edit the instances.</li>
    <li>Do not add more observations. Preprocessing of the observations is allowed.</li>
    <li>Do not directly edit the environment in the policy; just return your hyperparameter
        configuration as an action.</li>
</ul>
